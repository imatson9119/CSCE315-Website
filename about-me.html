        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <span class = intro><span class=tab></span>Hi, I'm Ian Matson. I am a current student at Texas A&M University studying computer science with prior work experience in full stack software development. 
        I've had extensive involvement with structural software such as DevOps and Git and am proficient in C#, Java, C++, and Python. I value teamwork
        above all else in professional environments- I believe nothing makes a bigger difference in quality of work and employee satistfaction than the
        creation of a healthy team-based environment.</span>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <div class = section>
        Perhaps the biggest aim in my life is to help others with what I do. Wherever I work, regardless of position or assignment, I want to be making the lives of other
        people better. In the context of computer science, this can look like a variety of things such as creating programs or streamlining employee workflows. For me specifically,
        it takes the form of software development. One of the most rewarding parts of producing a working piece of software is seeing it be used to make the jobs of
        other people easier. This past summer, I was fortunate enough to intern at Pioneer Natural Resources. While I was there, I was able to develop an application that 
        allowed geologists to easily create and edit descriptive diagrams of well locations. Before this application was created, an excessive amount of work was involved in
        the creation of these diagrams, and my web-application was able to eliminate a significant portion of this workload. Things like this are the reason I study computer
        science.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <div class = section>
        One of the things I'm most passionate about is music. I currently know how to play two instruments, piano and handpan, and am learning guitar. To me, music is
        more than simply a couple of sounds mixed together to create a song, it's a medium through which ideas are created and shared that brings people together.
        <br><br>
        Another activity I particularly enjoy is competitive coding. I regularly participate in coding competitions and am taking a competitive coding class this semester.
        One of the greatest things about competitive coding is that each problem is unique, and unique problems require unique solutions. While computer science can sometimes
        be viewed as a field that lacks much creative inspiration, competitive coding problems require contestants to think beyond what they've learned to create their own
        approach to each problem.
        <br><br>
        More than anything else, I enjoy nature. Whether it's mountain biking, hiking, or camping, anything that gets me outdoors is something I enjoy doing. There's something about
        being out in the middle of nowhere and watching the sunrise that can't quite be captured or explained. Unfortunately, this is a hobby I don't get to enjoy very frequently, as 
        there really isn't much in the way of terrain in College Station.
