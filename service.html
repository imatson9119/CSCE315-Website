					<h2>Grace Bible Church</h2>
					<h3>Production Team: 1/19-Present</h3>
					<div class="section">
						The biggest responsibility of production team members is to assist
						in setting up and tearing down the equipment required for each
						service. Since Grace Southwood's college service takes place in a
						high school theatre, nothing can stay from week to week and must be
						reconstructed each time. Aside from this, production team members
						are also responsible for running lights, sound, and video during the
						service.

					<h2>TAMU Hack</h2>
					<h3>Volunteer: 1/19</h3>
					<div class="section">
						TAMU Hack is an annual hackathon put on by students at Texas A&M.
						The hackathon isn't just a time where students can develop their
						skills and produce a usable product, but a place where recruiters
						can find potential employees. For this reason, many large companies
						will invest in TAMU Hack and provide challenges for students to
						complete. During this time, TAMU Hack volunteers do a number of
						things, including managing supplies giving to students,
						troubleshooting technical issues competitors may encounter, and
						ensuring fitting accommodations for recruiters.
