							Description
						</h3>
						<br />
						The goal of Hungry Ags is to provide a place where organizations can
						recruit students and students can enjoy the free food commonly
						provided at these events. This goal was accomplished by creating a
						web-based application using Angular where both students and
						organizations can post events that contain free food. These events
						are processed and stored using Google Firebase. If an organization
						wishes to make official postings rather than reporting as an
						individual, they can register their organization under an email.
						This request will be manually audited, and if approved, will grant
						that email to post as the organization. All subsequent events posted
						by this account will display a verified badge. The application is
						also fully compatible with mobile devices, allowing users to access
						it from virtually any device.

							Description

						<br />
						While interning at Pioneer Natural Resources, I was tasked with
						redesigning the company's employee login portal. Before this
						project, the employee login portal was from the early 2000s and
						didn't accurately reflect either Pioneer's image as a company or
						their current branding. During the project, I used HTML and CSS
						inside F5's service to create a more user friendly and modern
						interface to employees to interact with.

							Description
						</h3>
						<br />
						This was a personal project I worked on during my free time. While
						the project is not fully completed, it is currently under
						development and excpected to be complete by the end of 2020. The
						game itself is implemented using C# with Unity Framework, and is
						based around sliding a block of ice in the right sequence to move
						from level to level. Each level is represented with a two
						dimensional array, and is dynamically loaded. One of the most
						challenging problems I encountered while working on this project was
						optimizing performance. Because each level consisted of a large
						amount of cubes, loading and displaying levels was very intensive.
						To mitigate this issue, I designed an algorithm to group cubes into
						larger rectangles to reduce the total number of polygons generated.

							Description
						</h3>
						<br />
						This project took place during Datathon 2020, and won first place
						for Walmart's design challenge. The goal of the project was to map
						an optimal path between a random set of points in a typical Walmart
						layout. For each execution of the program, the given store layout
						was overlaid with a traffic heatmap representing the number of
						people in a given area. In the problem statement, an "optimal" path
						was defined as one that resulted in the lowest cumulative number of
						people encountered. To simplify this problem, our team split the
						issue into two main parts: 1. Determining the optimal order to visit
						the given points (a variation of the travelling salesman problem),
						and 2. Finding a valid and efficient path between each pair of
						points. For the first problem, we used simulated annealing to
						gradually approach the optimal solution, since finding the best
						possible solution is an np-complete problem. Once the optimal order
						was determined, we created a customized implementation of the A*
						pathfinding algorithm to connect each pair of points in an optimal
						fashion. More than anything, this project was a learning experience,
						since none of the members of our team had prior knowledge of either
						simulated annealing or the A* algorithm.
